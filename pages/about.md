# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}**,

I'm a creative person with a lot of hobbies. I like to do sports, and it's very important to me to enjoy life in the best way. I'm proudly Brazilian, living in Barcelona, learning the best aspects of Catalan culture and recognizing the things that I miss in Brazil that make my country unique.

I graduated as a physics engineer, and I'm completely in love with science and astrophysics. I know that it's a very rare course to choose, but I had the opportunity to learn a lot about math, physics, and the fundamental concepts that are the basis of the most technological things going on today.

The most impressive thing that I've done in these 6 years since graduation was my thesis with one of the study groups of the Bingo Telescope. With them, I learned how to separate stars from active galaxies, and I wrote a thesis named "star data analysis andidentification of distinct objects by t-SNE"

Right now, I work as a Data Engineer, and I can say that I had the luck of finishing my graduation at the right moment when the world is experiencing a revolution carried by data. As humanity, we are experiencing a huge development of predictions based on data, and that could impact everything from car traffic and advertising to medicine and healthcare. It's huge, and I'm glad to be living and working through this change.

I'm glad to be writing and communicating with you.

Enjoy the content.
