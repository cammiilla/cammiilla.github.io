# **About Me**

Hi I am **{{ site.author.name }}**,<br>
I hold a degree in Physics Engineering from the main university in Latin America, and currently work as a Data Engineer. During my academic journey, I got involved in many extracurricular projects and activities, and even after completing my degree, I remain curious and seek innovation and continuous learning. I have always stepped out of my comfort zone, left my hometown to pursue the best education Brazil could offer, and now I live in Spain seeking professional growth and learning.

This website aims to share ideas and make my presence in the world public and accessible.

Welcome, and do not hesitate to contact me by email or through LinkedIn.
