description: Practical techniques to improve focus, comfort, and productivity in remote work.

Since the beginning of my career as a data engineer, I’ve worked remotely. Over time, I’ve tested a variety of techniques to improve my comfort, productivity, and motivation while working remotely.

In the last two months, work has been especially challenging and demanding, which has made me apply all the methods I’ve  for staying fully focused:

**→ Silence and a Quiet Environment:** Working from coworking spaces and cafes is great, especially when tasks don’t demand much mental energy. But for deeply challenging problems, silence and a quiet environment are crucial to help maintain concentration.

**→ Abandon Multitasking:** Multitasking may seem unavoidable if you’re juggling multiple responsibilities at once, but remember that each task switch has a time cost. Every time you shift from one task to another, it takes a few minutes to refocus. By sticking to one task at a time, you can work more efficiently.

**→ Pomodoro Focus Timer:** You’ve probably heard of the Pomodoro Technique—it’s simple, effective, and really works. Spend 25 minutes fully focused on a single task, with no interruptions, then take a 5-10 minute break. Use this break to stretch, grab water, or enjoy a coffee, so you’re ready to come back. 

For Windows users, I recommend two applications: Focus To-Do (for a more complex app with multiple available settings) and PowerPom (basic and functional).

**→ Eisenhower Matrix for Prioritization:** In my personal life, I’m currently handling a lot of bureaucratic tasks, so I use the [Eisenhower Matrix](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/eisenhower-matrix)—a framework that organizes tasks by importance and urgency.

At the start of each week, I draw my matrix on paper. This helps prevent procrastination and keeps me focused on what’s urgent. While I use a physical version for my personal tasks, I prefer to use a digital tool like Notion for work, as it’s easier to adapt to frequent changes throughout the week.
